# Trading-Automator-Bot

Trading bot written in java.

Created this project a long time ago. Initially was meaning to create it into a commercial project to sell, but I left working on the project a while ago. Looking back on it and noticing how much work I had put into this, I decided to open source it to make it potentially be useful to someone else. Note: Because the project has not been maintained for a while, you may have to get it working with new exchange apis.
I know there are lots of private api keys and secrets in the project history and its current state. No worries, I looked through all the exchanges and disabled api's/withdrew.
